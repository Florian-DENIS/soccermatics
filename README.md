# soccermatics

Welcome to the repository containing the Python code associated with the "Soccermatics" course I took online between August and September 2023. 

This course is available free of charge to European students and explains how to work with football data using mathematics, statistics and machine learning. In particular, it uses data provided by Wyscout, Statsbomb, Metrica, Signality and Skillcorner.

I would like to make it clear that I personally understood the code and took possession of it, but that doesn't mean I own it. I've simply put it online to show what I have learnt and what I am capable of achieving.

Once again, I would like to thank David Sumpter, professor at Uppsala University and the main designer of the course, for the quality of the course, as well as all the professionals who took part in it.
